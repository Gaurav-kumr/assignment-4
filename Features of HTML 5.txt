Features of HTML 5
HTML5, the fifth and latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduces several new features and improvements over its predecessors. Here are some key features of HTML5:

Semantic Elements:

Introduces new semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, etc., which provide more meaningful structure to web documents.
Audio and Video Support:

Native support for embedding audio and video content using <audio> and <video> tags without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
Canvas Element:

Introduces the <canvas> element, allowing dynamic rendering of graphics and images through JavaScript. This is particularly useful for games, data visualization, and other interactive applications.
Improved Form Controls:

Enhancements to form controls with new input types like email, url, date, range, and more. Additionally, new attributes and form validation features are introduced.
Local Storage and Session Storage:

Provides a client-side storage solution through the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device.
Web Workers:

Enables the use of web workers to run scripts in the background, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance without affecting the user interface responsiveness.
Geolocation API:

Allows websites to access and use the user's geographical location information if the user grants permission. This is particularly useful for location-based services.
WebSockets:

Introduces the WebSocket protocol for real-time communication between the client and server, enabling more efficient and interactive web applications.
Responsive Design:

Supports responsive web design principles with features like the <picture> element, <srcset> attribute, and media queries, allowing developers to create websites that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
Drag and Drop:

Provides native support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it easier for users to interact with and manipulate elements on a web page.
Offline Web Applications:

Introduces features such as the Application Cache and the Service Worker API, allowing developers to create web applications that can work offline and provide a better user experience.
New Doctype:

Simplifies the DOCTYPE declaration to <!DOCTYPE html>, making it easier for developers and reducing the likelihood of errors in markup.
These features, among others, contribute to making HTML5 a more powerful and versatile language for building modern and interactive web applications.
