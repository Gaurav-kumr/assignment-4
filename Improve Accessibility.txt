Improve Accessibility

Three ways to improve the accessibility of HTML:

Semantic HTML:

Use semantic HTML elements to provide a clear and meaningful structure to your content. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the hierarchy and purpose of different page elements.

Provide Alternative Text for Images:

Use the alt attribute to provide descriptive alternative text for images. This is crucial for users who rely on screen readers to understand the content of images.

Ensure Keyboard Accessibility:

Make sure that all interactive elements on your website can be accessed and operated using a keyboard. This is essential for users who cannot use a mouse or other pointing devices.
