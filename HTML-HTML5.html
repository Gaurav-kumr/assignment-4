    <tr>
      <td>HTML (Before HTML5): Traditional HTML had limited semantic elements, and developers often used generic tags like div and span  to structure web content.</td>
      <td> Introduces a set of new semantic elements that provide more meaningful structure to documents. Examples include header, nav, artice , and more. These elements enhance the clarity of the document's structure and improve accessibility</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>In earlier versions of HTML, embedding multimedia content like audio and video required third-party plugins such as Flash.</td>
      <td> Native support for audio and video tags allows developers to embed audio and video content directly into HTML documents without relying on external plugins. This contributes to better performance, compatibility, and a more standardized approach to multimedia integration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Traditional HTML lacked a standardized way to store data on the client side, leading to the reliance on cookies for small amounts of data.</td>
      <td> Introduces the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, enabling web applications to store larger amounts of data on the client side persistently (localStorage) or for the duration of a session (sessionStorage). This provides a more efficient and flexible solution for client-side data storage.</td>
